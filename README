VERSION
    version 0.004

SYNOPSIS
        use CPAN::Meta::YAML;

        # methods for files
        $yaml = CPAN::Meta::YAML->read('META.yml');
        $yaml->write('MYMETA.yml');

        # methods for strings
        $yaml_text = $yaml->write_string;
        $yaml = CPAN::Meta::YAML->read_string($yaml_text);

        # finding the metadata
        my $meta = $yaml->[0];

        # handling errors
        $yaml->write($file)
          or die CPAN::Meta::YAML->errstr;

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a subset of the YAML specification for use in
    reading and writing CPAN metadata files like META.yml and MYMETA.yml. It
    should not be used for any other general YAML parsing or generation
    task.

SUPPORT
    This module is currently derived from YAML::Tiny by Adam Kennedy. If
    there are bugs in how it parses a particular META.yml file, please file
    a bug report in the YAML::Tiny bugtracker:
    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=YAML-Tiny>
