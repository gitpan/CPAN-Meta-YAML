NAME
    CPAN::Meta::YAML - Read and write a subset of YAML for CPAN Meta files

VERSION
    version 0.001

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a subset of the YAML specification for use in
    reading and writing CPAN metadata files like META.yml and MYMETA.yml. It
    should not be used for any other general YAML parsing or generation
    task.

SUPPORT
    This module is currently derived from YAML::Tiny by Adam Kennedy. If
    there are bugs in how it parses a particular META.yml file, please file
    a bug report in the YAML::Tiny bugtracker:
    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=YAML-Tiny>
